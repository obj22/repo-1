The main file to run is main_ML_backwards. The parameter \lambda should be changed during the training process in CNN/reverse_cnn_train. \lambda is initially set to 0.001 for 2000 epochs, and then it is incrememntally increased until the validation loss (averaged over the past 100 epochs) increases by 0.001. The nonlinear coherence should be taken from this point. This is detailed in the full paper to be published to ARXIV in late September.
